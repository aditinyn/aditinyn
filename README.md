Hi I'm Aditi! I'm an incoming freshman at NYU majoring in Mathematics and Computer Science. 

I'm interested in literally everything but some of my main interests are AI and ML, cryptography, and computational finance. 

I'm always looking for people to work with so you can reach out to me at aditinyn@gmail.com if you're interested!
